AARAA, A Machine Learning Model for Tomorrow

Note: If you want to use the regression model yourself:

both paths need to be indicated properly.

Make sure the path corresponding to your machine is written properly in code block #2 "data= pd.read.excel(r"....."). This should open the excel file with the data you are inputting.

Make sure the path corresponding to your machine is written properly in code block #12 "sys.path.insert(0, r"....."). This should lead to the folder in which the NGOS.py file is in.

So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased up
enough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce Hyperspace: a fun, blocky,
one-page design with a lot of color, a bit of animation, and an additional "generic" page template
(because hey, even one-page sites usually need an interior page or two). Hope you dig it :)
